# CMI Personal Internet Use - EDA and Predictive Machine Learning Model

This is my end-to-end data science project for the Child Mind Institute's Personal Internet Use Kaggle competition. Though the competition officially ended months ago, I figured this aligned neatly with my background working with kids, and would be a great way to learn to build a machine learning model.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Raw and processed data files (excluded from GitHub)
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for analysis and experiments
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for modeling and utility functions
- `models/`: Trained model files
